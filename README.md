This repo is a template for setting up a new python project on GitHub. After cloning and reinitialising this repository as described in the [SOP](http://mediawiki.internal.sanger.ac.uk/index.php/Creating_a_New_Pathogen_Project_on_GitHub), please make sure to do the following when creating a new project:

* A template for the README is available in the file called README_template.md. Please edit this file, then rename it to README.md (to overwrite _this_ file)
* Make sure to change the paths and URLs in the badges in the README and remove any that don't apply 
* Edit the years in the first line of the LICENSE file to match your project
* Consider adding the project to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh). For more information, see the [wiki](http://mediawiki.internal.sanger.ac.uk/index.php/Adding_Pathogen_packages_to_codecov)
